			The Frances Taylor Foundation Rota is designed to store customer and staff information, and has the ability to generate a
			rota from this information automatically. The information stored, includes personal details such as name, address and
			contact information.
		</p>
		<p class="card-text">
			Availability &amp; working times are associated to each client and staff member respectively. With this information to hand,
			the application can best determine how and when to allocate field staff to clients in the community in order to provide
			the neccessary support based on availability.
		</p>
		<p class="card-text">
			The benefit that this provides, is that allocating staff support for clients is an arduous task. Automating the process can
			cut down on the time spent manually attempting to pair staff with clients for specific times. Providing a high-level overview
			also allows for easy amendments where necessary. It also provides a centralised place to store all necessary contact information
			such as telephone numbers, E-mail addreses and residential addresses. Rota entries can be marked as completed, and with
			this data, invoicing can be derived.

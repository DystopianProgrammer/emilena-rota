			The project is open source and free to use. It uses the Google Maps API - Distance Radius Matrix for determing distances
			between appointments and map generation. This is currently capped to the free version for non-commercial use. It also
			uses getaddress.io for address look-ups using a postcode. Again this is limited to the free version. Both have daily quotas.
			If this is insufficient for your purposes, then consider upgrading each package; neither of which are expensive. All the
			source code is available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/DystopianProgrammer">https://github.com/DystopianProgrammer</a>
		</p>
		<p class="card-text">The demo version of this application is currently deployed on DigitalOcean within two docker containers. The project is
			provided with docker files for ease of use and easy deployment. With docker, you can have the application up and running
			within your own environment in a matter of minutes. If you require assistance with this, please contact me for additional
			support, though reasonable fees will apply.</p>

		<p class="card-text"><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
		<p class="card-text">The configuration is done through a yaml file which is located in the emilena-docker repository: <a href="https://github.com/DystopianProgrammer/emilena-docker">https://github.com/DystopianProgrammer/emilena-docker</a></p>
		<p>Within this project there are 3x directories.</p>
		<ul class="card-text">
			<li>api</li>
			<li>db</li>
			<li>web</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="card-text">The api directory contains a shell script which takes a single parameter which points to the dropwizard project. It then
			downloads and installs any dependencies and then starts up a docker container. <strong>emilena.yaml</strong> provides
			all the necessary configuration for the application. For example the SQL Dialect, and all application settings under 'applicationConfiguration'</p>
		<p class="card-text">The db directory just provides a DDL for the database. This is generated from a PostgreSQL export.</p>
		<p class="card-text">The web directory, similar to the api directory, also provides a shell script which takes a single parameter pointing to
			the front end web project.</p>
		<p class="card-text">To run each script, simply type ./run.sh /location/to/deployable/project</p>
		<p class="card-text">To build each deployable, from the emilena-api project, ensure you have Apache Maven installed, and run <strong>mvn clean package</strong>.
			To build the emilena-rota front-end, ensure you have ng cli installed using npm. First install all dependencies by typing
			<strong>npm install</strong>. Once that is done, then from the same project, type <strong>ng build --prod</strong></p>
		<p class="card-text">The front-end is deployed in an Nginx HTTP server, and the configuration file for this is located in the same docker directory.
			However the application could be deployed with any HTTP server including over HTTPS. Proxying is required to prevent CORS.</p>
